## CVE-2022-29464
 Certain WSO2 products allow unrestricted file upload with resultant remote code execution. The attacker must use a /fileupload endpoint with a Content-Disposition directory traversal sequence to reach a directory under the web root, such as a ../../../../repository/deployment/server/webapps directory. This affects WSO2 API Manager 2.2.0 and above through 4.0.0; WSO2 Identity Server 5.2.0 and above through 5.11.0; WSO2 Identity Server Analytics 5.4.0, 5.4.1, 5.5.0, and 5.6.0; WSO2 Identity Server as Key Manager 5.3.0 and above through 5.10.0; and WSO2 Enterprise Integrator 6.2.0 and above through 6.6.0.

## CVE-2021-4034
 A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit's pkexec utility. The pkexec application is a setuid tool designed to allow unprivileged users to run commands as privileged users according predefined policies. The current version of pkexec doesn't handle the calling parameters count correctly and ends trying to execute environment variables as commands. An attacker can leverage this by crafting environment variables in such a way it'll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. When successfully executed the attack can cause a local privilege escalation given unprivileged users administrative rights on the target machine.

## CVE-2021-3560
 It was found that polkit could be tricked into bypassing the credential checks for D-Bus requests, elevating the privileges of the requestor to the root user. This flaw could be used by an unprivileged local attacker to, for example, create a new local administrator. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

## CVE-2021-3129
 Ignition before 2.5.2, as used in Laravel and other products, allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because of insecure usage of file_get_contents() and file_put_contents(). This is exploitable on sites using debug mode with Laravel before 8.4.2.

## CVE-2018-19052
 An issue was discovered in mod_alias_physical_handler in mod_alias.c in lighttpd before 1.4.50. There is potential ../ path traversal of a single directory above an alias target, with a specific mod_alias configuration where the matched alias lacks a trailing '/' character, but the alias target filesystem path does have a trailing '/' character.
